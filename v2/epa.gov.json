ECHO provides integrated compliance and enforcement information for over 1 million regulated facilities nationwide.\n   RCRA Rest Services provides multiple service endpoints, each with specific capabilities, to search and retrieve data on hazardous waste handlers/facilities regulated under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA).   The returned results reflect data drawn from EPA's RCRAInfo database.\n\\\nThe get_facilities, get_map, get_qid, and get_download end points are meant to be used together, while the enhanced get_facility_info end point is self contained.\n  The get_facility_info end point returns either an array of state, county or zip clusters with summary statistics per cluster or an array of facilities.\n\\\nThe recommended use scenario for get_facilities, get_qid, get_map, and get_downoad is:\n\\\n <b>1)</b>  Use get_facilities to validate passed query parameters, obtain summary statistics and to obtain a query_id (QID).  QIDs are time sensitive and will be valid for approximately 30 minutes.\n <b>2)</b>  Use get_qid, with the returned QID, to paginate through arrays of facility results.\n <b>3)</b>  Use get_map, with the returned QID, to zoom in/out and pan on the clustered and individual facility coordinates that meet the QID query criteria.\n <b>4)</b>  Use get_download, with the returned QID, to generate a Comma Separated Value (CSV) file of facility information that meets the QID query criteria.\n\\\n\\\nUse the qcolumns parameter to customize your search results.  Use the Metadata service endpoint for a list of available output objects, their Column Ids, and their definitions to help you build your customized output. \n\\\nAdditional ECHO Resources:   <a href=\"https://echo.epa.gov/tools/web-services\">Web Services</a>, <a href=\"https://echo.epa.gov/resources/echo-data/about-the-data\">About ECHO's Data</a>, <a href=\"https://echo.epa.gov/tools/data-downloads\">Data Downloads</a>\n ",
