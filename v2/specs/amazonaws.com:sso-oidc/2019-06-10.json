    "description": "<p>AWS IAM Identity Center (successor to AWS Single Sign-On) OpenID Connect (OIDC) is a web service that enables a client (such as AWS CLI or a native application) to register with IAM Identity Center. The service also enables the client to fetch the user’s access token upon successful authentication and authorization with IAM Identity Center.</p> <note> <p>Although AWS Single Sign-On was renamed, the <code>sso</code> and <code>identitystore</code> API namespaces will continue to retain their original name for backward compatibility purposes. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/what-is.html#renamed\">IAM Identity Center rename</a>.</p> </note> <p> <b>Considerations for Using This Guide</b> </p> <p>Before you begin using this guide, we recommend that you first review the following important information about how the IAM Identity Center OIDC service works.</p> <ul> <li> <p>The IAM Identity Center OIDC service currently implements only the portions of the OAuth 2.0 Device Authorization Grant standard (<a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8628\">https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8628</a>) that are necessary to enable single sign-on authentication with the AWS CLI. Support for other OIDC flows frequently needed for native applications, such as Authorization Code Flow (+ PKCE), will be addressed in future releases.</p> </li> <li> <p>The service emits only OIDC access tokens, such that obtaining a new token (For example, token refresh) requires explicit user re-authentication.</p> </li> <li> <p>The access tokens provided by this service grant access to all AWS account entitlements assigned to an IAM Identity Center user, not just a particular application.</p> </li> <li> <p>The documentation in this guide does not describe the mechanism to convert the access token into AWS Auth (“sigv4”) credentials for use with IAM-protected AWS service endpoints. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/PortalAPIReference/API_GetRoleCredentials.html\">GetRoleCredentials</a> in the <i>IAM Identity Center Portal API Reference Guide</i>.</p> </li> </ul> <p>For general information about IAM Identity Center, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/what-is.html\">What is IAM Identity Center?</a> in the <i>IAM Identity Center User Guide</i>.</p>",
