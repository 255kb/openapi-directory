    "description": "Space has a hostile radiation environment that increases the risk of cancers in humans and malfunctions in spacecraft electronics. The types of space  radiation of primary concern are:\n  <ul>\n    <li>\n        Galactic Cosmic Rays from outside our solar system generated by \n        supernovae and other phenomena;\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Solar Energetic Particles produced by the Sun during intense and\n        sporadic bursts of activity; and\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Trapped Radiation: energetic particles confined by Earth's magnetic\n        field, usually comprising an inner belt of mostly high energy protons \n        and an outer belt dominated by lower energy electrons and plasma.\n    </li>\n  </ul> \n\nUnderstanding the space radiation environment for a particular mission profile is becoming increasingly important. Commercial off-the-shelf electronic components  that aren't resilient to space radiation are now prevalent. Longer duration  missions to cislunar space, Mars, and beyond are placing astronauts at greater  risk of radiation exposure. <br><br>\nAPI requests must contain a key \"API-Key\" in the header (see code samples).
