    "description": "This API is used for the classic integration. If you are just starting your implementation, refer to our [new integration guide](https://docs.adyen.com/marketplaces-and-platforms) instead.\n\nThe Notification Configuration API provides endpoints for setting up and testing notifications that inform you of events on your platform, for example when a verification check or a payout has been completed.\n\nFor more information, refer to our [documentation](https://docs.adyen.com/marketplaces-and-platforms/classic/notifications).\n## Authentication\nYour Adyen contact will provide your API credential and an API key. To connect to the API, add an `X-API-Key` header with the API key as the value, for example:\n\n ```\ncurl\n-H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n-H \"X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY\" \\\n...\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can use the username and password to connect to the API using basic authentication. For example:\n\n```\ncurl\n-U \"ws@MarketPlace.YOUR_PLATFORM_ACCOUNT\":\"YOUR_WS_PASSWORD\" \\\n-H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n...\n```\nWhen going live, you need to generate new web service user credentials to access the [live endpoints](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/live-endpoints).\n\n## Versioning\nThe Notification Configuration API supports [versioning](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/versioning) using a version suffix in the endpoint URL. This suffix has the following format: \"vXX\", where XX is the version number.\n\nFor example:\n```\nhttps://cal-test.adyen.com/cal/services/Notification/v6/createNotificationConfiguration\n```",
