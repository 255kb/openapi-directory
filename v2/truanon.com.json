There is no setup or dependencies, nothing to store or process. Making identity part of your service is fun, and youâ€™ll be up and running in a matter of minutes.\n\nTruAnon Private Token is used anytime you request information from TruAnon and you must edit this into the Variables section for this collection.\n\nThis API contains two endpoints and both require these same two arguments, also found in the Variables section of this collection.\n\nThese two arguments are:\n\nTruAnon Service Identifier\n\nand\n\nYour Member Name\n\nYour TruAnon Service Identifier was provided by TruAnon and is likely the root domain of your site or service. Your Member Name is the unique member ID on your system that you would like to query.\n\nInformation is continuously updated for display purposes and aside from performance considerations, there should be no need to capture or save anything from TruAnon.",
